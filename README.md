Master's student in Germany specialising in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

Passionate about leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning to solve complex challenges. My project experience includes building predictive models for finance (credit card fraud, stock prediction), e-commerce (car price prediction), healthcare (disease prediction), and NLP (spam classification).

I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in data analysis, model development, and problem-solving to real-world projects. Open to collaborations and discussions in the AI and Data Science space.
